# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Project Structure and File Overview

Here is a breakdown of the key files and directories in this project:

### Root Directory

-   **`next.config.ts`**: Configuration file for Next.js. It includes settings for image optimization and build process adjustments.
-   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Configuration for the Tailwind CSS framework, where you define the design system (e.g., colors, fonts, spacing).
-   **`package.json`**: Lists all project dependencies (like React, Next.js, Genkit) and defines scripts for running, building, and testing the application (e.g., `npm run dev`).
-   **`components.json`**: Configuration file for `shadcn/ui`, defining paths and settings for the UI components.
-   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript configuration file, which sets the rules for how TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript.

### `src/` Directory

This is where the main source code for the application resides.

#### `src/app/`

This directory uses the Next.js App Router for routing, pages, and layouts.

-   **`page.tsx`**: The main entry point for the dashboard UI. This is the primary component rendered for the root URL (`/`).
-   **`layout.tsx`**: The root layout for the application. It wraps all pages and is used to include global elements like fonts, stylesheets, and the main `<body>` tag.
-   **`globals.css`**: The global stylesheet. It defines the base styles for the application, including CSS variables for theming (e.g., `--background`, `--primary`) and Tailwind CSS directives.
-   **`actions.ts`**: Contains Server Actions. These are server-side functions that can be called directly from client-side components, used for handling form submissions and data mutations securely without needing to create separate API endpoints (e.g., `downloadReportAction`, `searchAction`).

#### `src/components/`

This folder contains all the reusable React components.

-   **`dashboard/`**: Contains the high-level widgets that make up the main dashboard grid, such as `TimeSeriesChart.tsx`, `ChoroplethMap.tsx`, and `RiskHeatmap.tsx`.
-   **`filters/`**: Holds the components used for data filtering in the sidebar, like `LocationFilter.tsx` and `DateRangeFilter.tsx`.
-   **`layout/`**: Structural components that define the overall layout of the app, including `Header.tsx`, `AppSidebar.tsx`, and `HelpDrawer.tsx`.
-   **`ui/`**: Base UI components from `shadcn/ui`, such as `Button.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, and `Input.tsx`. These are the fundamental building blocks for the UI.

#### `src/lib/`

A central place for shared code, data, type definitions, and utilities.

-   **`data.ts`**: The source of mock data for the application's visualizations (e.g., time-series data, risk scores). In a production app, this would be replaced by API calls to a live database.
-   **`locations.ts`**: Contains the hierarchical location data (divisions, districts, etc.) used by the location filter.
-   **`types.ts`**: Defines all the core TypeScript types used across the application (e.g., `Location`, `Disease`, `TimeSeriesDataPoint`), ensuring data consistency.
-   **`utils.ts`**: Contains utility functions, most notably the `cn` function for conditionally combining Tailwind CSS class names.
-   **`weather.ts`**: Includes the server-side logic for fetching live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

#### `src/ai/`

This directory holds all the Generative AI logic, powered by Genkit.

-   **`genkit.ts`**: Initializes and configures the core Genkit instance, including setting up the model provider (e.g., Google AI).
-   **`flows/`**: Contains the AI workflows (flows). Each file defines a specific multi-step AI task.
    -   `data-qa.ts`: Powers the natural language search bar, answering questions based on the provided data context.
    -   `generate-report-from-prompt.ts`: Handles the logic for generating downloadable reports based on user prompts and filters.
    -   `data-insights-from-prompt.ts`: An AI agent for generating insights from data.
